# polyglot-guide

Guides for programming language ecosystems.

A lot of programming languages today provide very similar tools (package manager, version manager, linter, etc.) for their ecosystems.

This repository aims to list those tools and highlight differences in ecosystems for anyone who needs a quickstart in a foreign language for exploratory or bugfix reasons.

This repository does not aim to provide extensive language guides that teach the idioms of the languages, which you should learn if you want to use a language on a daily basis.
